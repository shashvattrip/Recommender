Recommender
===========

Movie Recommendation App in C#
Uses a database of 100,000 movie ratings made by around 1900 users.
Each user has rated atleast 20 movies.
Recommendations are based on the history of movie ratings and by using a Similarity Coefficient.
A typical example of handshake problem.

Will add updates soon.
Ignore the horrible GUI. :D
